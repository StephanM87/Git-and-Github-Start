    "### Step 1: Git status\n",

    "- **m:** This means message. Every commit (versioning process) is supplemented by a comment. This is important, since you will not have one versione but many!

Furthermore, you will probably use Software like VSCode or Github desktop, which provide an user interface. But this is very dependent on how your work will continue. Github reveals its power especially when collaborating with other colleagues. In Github, you will find a whole project management platform, which will help you to organise your work.
